# Workshop 4

By: Nitika Chopra

## Emphasis 

In only 60 years, the field of ***computing and information systems*** has redefined the traditional ways of business, education, government, and entertainment.  Virtually every organization and every field of study rely on computers and related technologies to succeed in the Information Age.  Even our everyday vocabulary embraces words like The Internet, email, Google, Facebook, YouTube, MP3, ATM, and Wii.

The study of computing and information systems is central to our understanding of how the world processes, manages and communicates information using digital technologies.  As a student, you learn to build and use computing and information systems.  You learn to see things from a broader systems perspective and to develop integrated solutions that meet the needs of your users.  And you learn to appreciate the far-reaching cultural, ethical, and legal impact of digital systems.
